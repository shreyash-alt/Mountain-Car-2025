# Mountain Car RL Environment

This project is based on a [YouTube tutorial by sentdex] that demonstrates the concepts of RL. I replaced `gym` with `gymnasium` for better compatibility with newer NumPy versions. The code here shows avg, min,max and its graph of reward throught training, the episode at which the goal was first achieved and a one episode render at last.

- Added keyboard shortcuts for controlling the camera feed
- Experimented with different tracker types (KCF, CSRT)
